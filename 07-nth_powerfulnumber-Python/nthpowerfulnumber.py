# nthPowerfulNumber(n) [20 pts]
# Write the function nthPowerfulNumber(n). See here for details. So nthPowerfulNumber(0) returns 
# 1, and nthPowerfulNumber(10) returns 64.
# A number n is said to be Powerful Number if for every prime factor p of it, p2 also divides it. 
# For example:- 36 is a powerful number. It is divisible by both 3 and square of 3 i.e, 9.
