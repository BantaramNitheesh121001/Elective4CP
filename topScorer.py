# topScorer(data) [10 Points]
# Write the function topScorer(data) that takes a multi-line 
# string encoding scores as csv data for some kind of 
# competition with players receiving scores, so each 
# line has comma-separated values. The first value on 
# each line is the name of the player (which you can 
# assume has no integers in it), and each value after 
# that is an individual score (which you can assume is a 
# non-negative integer). You should add all the scores 
# for that player, and then return the player with the 
# highest total score. If there is a tie, return all the 
# tied players in a comma-separated string with the names 
# in the same order they appeared in the original data. 
# If nobody wins (there is no data), return None (not the 
# string "None"). So, for example:

def topScorer(data):
    # Your code goes here...
    if data == "":
        return None
    l = []
    data = data.splitlines()
    for i in range (len(data)):
        data[i] = data[i].split(",")
    for i in range (len(data)):
        val = 0
        for j in range (len(data[i])):
            if j == 0:
                l.append(data[i][j])
            else:
                val += int(data[i][j])
        l.append(val)
    val = 0
    output = ''
    for i in range (1,len(l),2):
        if l[i] > val:
            val = l[i]
            output = l[i-1]
        elif l[i] == val:
            output += ","+ l[i-1]
        i += 2
        if i > len(l):
            break
    return output
